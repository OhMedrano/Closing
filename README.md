Closing
=======

	I am going to try and create a simple webpage that has the list of the closing procedures, because I keep forgetting shit.
		The main things I need to work on is the form creation, just a simple li with a radio button, which shall toggle a boolean. 
								
				<form>
					<input type="checkbox" name="coffeeArea" value="coffeeCounter">Is the counter wiped down?</br>

					etc

	From this, I shall create an outline of the basic premises of closing. 

			Closing
				|-Coffee Area
				|	|-Coffee Pots
				|	|-Coffee Counter
				|	|-Muffin Trays
				|	|-Restock Teas
				|	|-Restock Coffee Beans
				|	|-Restock Cups
				|	|-Stamp Cups
	
	You get the idea. 

	Once I get that done, I will start styling up the page.
	This will give me a good grasp on either my css skills or my bootstrap skills. I'm not sure if I am up to use bootstrap, mostly due to the fact that I like to customize my stuff. So let's write down some pros and cons.

			Custom CSS
				+ Can create customed divs for a specific portion.
				+ Can manipulate any part needed
				- Can get confusing with multiple specific divs
				- Can get time consuming creating it

			Bootstrap
				+ Uniformed styles
				+ Classes pre-defined
				+ Fast to implement once learnt
				- Bit of a learning curve
				- Some things may not be customized
				- Will look like every other bootstrap site...

	That final one is my biggest issue.
