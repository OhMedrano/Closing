Closing
=======

	I am going to try and create a simple webpage that has the list of the closing procedures, because I keep forgetting shit.
		The main things I need to work on is the form creation, just a simple li with a radio button, which shall toggle a boolean. 
								
				<form>
					<input type="checkbox" name="coffeeArea" value="coffeeCounter">Is the counter wiped down?</br>

					etc

	From this, I shall create an outline of the basic premises of closing. 

			Closing
				|-Coffee Area
				|	|-Coffee Pots
				|	|-Coffee Counter
				|	|-Muffin Trays
				|	|-Restock Teas
				|	|-Restock Coffee Beans
				|	|-Restock Cups
				|	|-Stamp Cups
	
	You get the idea. 

	Once I get that done, I will start styling up the page.
	This will give me a good grasp on either my css skills or my bootstrap skills. I'm not sure if I am up to use bootstrap, mostly due to the fact that I like to customize my stuff. So let's write down some pros and cons.

			Custom CSS
				+ Can create customed divs for a specific portion.
				+ Can manipulate any part needed
				- Can get confusing with multiple specific divs
				- Can get time consuming creating it

			Bootstrap
				+ Uniformed styles
				+ Classes pre-defined
				+ Fast to implement once learnt
				- Bit of a learning curve
				- Some things may not be customized
				- Will look like every other bootstrap site...

	That final one is my biggest issue.

	WELL NOW! I hate and love bootstrap. 

	Currently: 
		+ Quick CSS implementation
		+ Somewhat quicker typing combined with sublime packages (Huge plus)

		- The bootstrap jquery aren't firing off. Loads fine though
		- Have to psuedo reverse engineer the actions that aren't firing off. (Huge negative)


	That's where I am at right now. For some reason the bootstrap js aren't functioning. It might be due to the bootstrap snippet package that I've installed on to sublime. They might be using dated tags which I would have to update manually...

	However, just in case that doesn't work... I have a js file that has the bootstrap jquery code that I'm kind of reverse engineering. Good jquery practice, I guess.
