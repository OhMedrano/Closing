Closing
=======

I am going to try and create a simple webpage that has the list of the closing procedures, because I keep forgetting shit.
		The main things I need to work on is the form creation, just a simple li with a radio button, which shall toggle a boolean. 
								
				<form>
					<input type="checkbox" name="coffeeArea" value="coffeeCounter">Is the counter wiped down?</br>

					etc

	From this, I shall create an outline of the basic premises of closing.
